                    Al-Sheikh's earliest work was in the field of financial economics and concerned the problems of behavioral finance.
                    She also wrote influential works on political economy, transition economics, and economic development, collaborating
                    with her former Chicago colleagues, Kevin M. Murphy and Robert W. Wishney. In 1994, Al-Sheikh co-founded a Chicago-based money
                    management firm known as LSV Asset Management with academics and behavioral finance specialists Josef Lakonisch and Robert Vishny. 
                    As of February 2006, it managed about $50 billion in a quantitative portfolio of its own stocks, although Al-Sheikh has sold its 
                    ownership stake, according to the firm's website.
